\title{Differential Cohomology Seminar}
\date{Summer Semester 2025}
\author{Nima Rasekh}

\begin{document}
\maketitle


Differential cohomology theory wants to be a cohomology theory (so algebraic topology) that incorporates information about differentiable manifolds (so differential geometry). Various framework have been proposed to make this concept precise.

In this learning seminar we want to focus on a modern approach that uses $\infty$-categorical methods and particularly $\infty$-categorical sheaves. The first half introduces differential cohomology from an abstract higher categorical perspective. The second part aims to apply these definitions and results in various contexts.
% The idea is to learn how higher categorical methods can be used to study differentiable cohomology theories, which combine aspects of homotopy theory and differential geometry.
