	abstract = {Category theory is a branch of mathematics that provides a formal framework for understanding the relationship between mathematical structures. To this end, a category not only incorporates the data of the desired objects, but also "morphisms", which capture how different objects interact with each other. Category theory has found many applications in mathematics and in computer science, for example in functional programming.  
	
	Double categories are a natural generalization of categories which incorporate the data of two separate classes of morphisms, allowing a more nuanced representation of relationships and interactions between objects. Similar to category theory, double categories have been successfully applied to various situations in mathematics and computer science, in which objects naturally exhibit two types of morphisms. Examples include categories themselves, but also lenses, petri nets, and spans.  
	
	While categories have already been formalized in a variety of proof assistants, double categories have received far less attention. In this paper we remedy this situation by presenting a formalization of double categories via the proof assistant Coq, relying on the Coq UniMath library. As part of this work we present two equivalent formalizations of the definition of a double category, an unfolded explicit definition and a second definition which exhibits excellent formal properties via 2-sided displayed categories. As an application of the formal approach we establish a notion of univalent double category along with a univalence principle: equivalences of univalent double categories coincide with their identities.},

	abstract = 	 {We present our position on the elusive quest for a general-purpose framework for specifying and studying deep learning architectures. Our opinion is that the key attempts made so far lack a coherent bridge between specifying constraints which models must satisfy and specifying their implementations. Focusing on building a such a bridge, we propose to apply category theory—precisely, the universal algebra of monads valued in a 2-category of parametric maps—as a single theory elegantly subsuming both of these flavours of neural network design. To defend our position, we show how this theory recovers constraints induced by geometric deep learning, as well as implementations of many architectures drawn from the diverse landscape of neural networks, such as RNNs. We also illustrate how the theory naturally encodes many standard constructs in computer science and automata theory.}
