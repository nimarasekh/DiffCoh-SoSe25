This the small webpage for a seminar on differential cohomology theory at the Universität Greifswald in summer semester 2025. The goal is to learn something about differential cohomology using the sheaves of spectra formalism.

Up until now, we have broadly relied (or want to rely) on the following sources (with possibly more in the future): 
- [A short course on ∞-categories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2925) by [Moritz Groth/Rahn](https://www.agtz.mathematik.uni-mainz.de/hoeherekategorientheorie/dr-moritz-rahn/) for some ∞-categorical background material.
- [Higher Topos Theory](https://www.math.ias.edu/~lurie/papers/HTT.pdf) by [Jacob Lurie](https://www.math.ias.edu/~lurie) for some background on ∞-categorical sheaf theory and some advanced ∞-category theory.
- [Differential Cohomology: Categories, Characteristic Classes, and Connections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12250) by [Araminta Amabel](https://amabel3.github.io/), [Arun Debray](https://adebray.github.io/), [Peter J. Haine](https://math.berkeley.edu/~phaine/) for an ∞-categorical approach to differential cohomology via sheaves of spectra, and an overview into many different results and applications.
- [Differential cohomology theories as sheaves of spectra](https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.3188) by [Ulrich Bunke](https://bunke.app.uni-regensburg.de/), [Thomas Nikolaus](https://www.uni-muenster.de/FB10srvi/persdb/MM-member.php?id=1304), Michael Völkl for a detailed study of the ∞-categorical sheaf approach to differential cohomology.
- [Twisted differential cohomology](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3231) by [Ulrich Bunke](https://bunke.app.uni-regensburg.de/), [Thomas Nikolaus](https://www.uni-muenster.de/FB10srvi/persdb/MM-member.php?id=1304) for an introduction and study of twisted differential cohomology.
- [Differential cohomology in a cohesive infinity-topos](https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7930) by [Urs Schreiber](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/research/faculty-labs-and-projects/cqts/urs-schreiber.html) for a study of differential cohomology in the setting of cohesive ∞-topoi.
