This the small webpage for a seminar on differential cohomology theory at the Universit√§t Greifswald in summer semester 2025. The goal is to learn something about differential cohomology using the sheaves of spectra formalism.

We broadly follow the textbook [Differential Cohomology: Categories, Characteristic Classes, and Connections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12250)).
