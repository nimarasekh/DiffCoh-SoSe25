This the small webpage for a seminar on differential cohomology theory at the Universität Greifswald in summer semester 2025. The goal is to learn something about differential cohomology using the sheaves of spectra formalism.

Up until now, we have broadly relied on the following sources (with possibly more in the future): 
- [Differential Cohomology: Categories, Characteristic Classes, and Connections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.12250) by [Araminta Amabel](https://amabel3.github.io/), [Arun Debray](https://adebray.github.io/), [Peter J. Haine](https://math.berkeley.edu/~phaine/) for an ∞-categorical approach to differential cohomology via sheaves of spectra.
- [A short course on ∞-categories](https://arxiv.org/abs/1007.2925) by [Moritz Groth/Rahn](https://www.agtz.mathematik.uni-mainz.de/hoeherekategorientheorie/dr-moritz-rahn/) for some ∞-categorical background material.
- [Higher Topos Theory](https://www.math.ias.edu/~lurie/papers/HTT.pdf) by [Jacob Lurie](https://www.math.ias.edu/~lurie) for some background on ∞-categorical sheaf theory and some advanced ∞-category theory.

Until now we had the following talks with some modest attempt at live-texing their talks:
